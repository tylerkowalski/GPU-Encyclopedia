# GPU-Encyclopedia

I've created this repository as a reference for myself and others about everything GPU [architecture, compute, graphics, APIs, etc]. Rather than be a complete resource, I am hoping for this to be a compilation of information that **I**  have come across and would like to refer to in the future. There is a section on C++, since it is nuanced enough that there are also plenty of topics worth future reference. 

Included as well is tylerBLAS & tylerDNN, which are subsets of cuBLAS & cuDNN. They serve as a learning tool & reference for writing optimized kernels.
