# GPU-Encyclopedia

I've created this repository as a reference for myself and others about everything GPU [architecture, compute, graphics, APIs, etc]. Rather than be a complete resource, I am hoping for this to be a compilation of *only* the most clear and high-quality definitions that I have found through my own research on topics that were not immediately clear. 

If there are any API-related comments (e.g "after pipeline creation..."), I am referring to Vulkan.
